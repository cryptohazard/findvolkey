This tool attempts to decrypt EncFS volumes that were first created between
2006 and 2008 using vulnerable Debian versions of OpenSSL. These versions
produced predictable random numbers from a very small range (~32K possible
start values). Therefore, volume keys generated with vulnerable versions can
be recovered without knowledge of the password.

EncFS, like other encryption software, does not encrypt the files directly
with the password, but generates a random volume key to encrypt all files,
and then encrypts the volume key with the password and stores it. This
allows the password to be changed without having to re-encrypt the data
itself, only the stored volume key has to be re-encrypted.

This software does not recover the password itself (this is infeasible).
Instead, it recovers predictable volume keys generated by vulnerable OpenSSL
versions. As such, it can be used on any volume that has initially been
created using such a vulnerable version, even if the password has been
changed since.

MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF THE VOLUME YOU WANT TO DECRYPT BEFORE USING THIS TOOL.
HERE'S WHY:
Things than can go wrong, and, if your data is valuable, will go wrong:
- If the volume was encrypted by a non-vulnerable key, but this tool
  incorrectly believes that it has recovered the key, and overwrites the
  encfs config file, then it is impossible to decrypt the volume, even using
  the original password.
- The tool attempts to make a backup of the original config file before
  overwriting it, but do not rely on this working correctly in every case.
- Finally, if the volume is mounted using an incorrect key and subsequently
  modified, it may be possible that the data itself is corrupted (although I
  cannot exactly imagine how). So then you have a backup of the original
  config file, but corrupted data that you will not be able to decrypt
  anymore.
